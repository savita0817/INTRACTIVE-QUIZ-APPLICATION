## I  created a quiz application that consists of two main pages: a login page and a quiz page. ##
****1. Login Page:****
The login page asks users for their name before they can begin the quiz.
It has an input field for the user to type their name and a login button.
When the user submits the form, the application checks if the name is provided. If yes, it saves the name in localStorage and then redirects the user to the quiz page. If the name is missing, an alert asks the user to enter their name.
The login page is styled with a clean and simple design using a blue theme.
****2. Quiz Page:****
The quiz page contains a series of questions with multiple-choice answers.
The questions are stored in an array with options and the correct answer for each question.
When the page loads, it shows the first question and the options as buttons. The user can click one option to answer the question.
After selecting an answer, the page gives feedback (correct or incorrect) and disables the answer buttons.
The user can click the “Next Question” button to move to the next question.
Once all the questions are answered, the quiz ends, and the user's score is shown.
The quiz page also uses a smooth animation for displaying questions and answers.

****Key Features:****
**Login Process:** Users must log in by entering their name before starting the quiz.
**Quiz Questions:** Questions and answers are pre-defined in an array, and the user must select the correct option.
**Feedback:** After answering, feedback is given whether the answer was correct or incorrect.
**Score:** At the end, the user's score is displayed based on the number of correct answers.
**Page Styling: **Both pages (login and quiz) are styled with a simple, modern design using blue as the main color.

****Technologies:****
The HTML is used to structure the content on both pages.
The CSS is used to style both pages and make them visually appealing with animations and hover effects.
The JavaScript handles the logic for user interaction, like checking answers, navigating questions, storing data, and handling form submissions.

I build a quiz application with a login feature that asks users to input their name before taking the quiz.
The quiz gives feedback on answers and shows the score at the end.
In future we add more functinalities in it like, i add multiple user to play this or solve this simultaneously with some specify time period .
